                        <h3>My life</h3>
                        <p class="hidden-text">Hello, I am Bayan, a woman of 21 years, thoroughly captivated by the fields of technology, linguistics, and art. As an Arabic native speaker, I also command a proficient use of Norwegian as my second language, and English as my third. The multilingual skill set I possess is not only a testament to my abilities but also affords me the privilege of thriving in multicultural settings. Moreover, it empowers me with the ability to interact seamlessly with individuals from a vast array of backgrounds. My linguistic journey continues with my current endeavour of acquiring Turkish. I am always on the lookout for fresh challenges and means to broaden my worldly comprehension.

                            Currently, I am immersing myself in the rigorous academic environment of Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet), pursuing a degree in computer engineering. The ceaseless pursuit of knowledge and the quest to wield technology as a tool for societal improvement is my academic mantra. My specialization and interest lie in the areas of frontend development and website design. I cherish the ability to amalgamate my artistic creativity and technical prowess into the creation of websites that are not only functional but also aesthetically appealing. The satisfaction derived from the transmutation of a mere concept into a fully functional and visually pleasing website is, to me, a source of immense gratification.
                            
                            Away from the scholarly environment, I find solace in the pursuit of photography. A hobby that allows me to capture fleeting moments and the inherent beauty of everyday life, presenting the ordinary in an extraordinary light through my lens. It is an activity that I derive profound joy from and forms an integral part of my personal identity.
                            
                            As I gaze upon the horizon, I find my resolve firming to contribute to the advancement of technology. Armed with a steadfast dedication to lifelong learning, a wealth of creativity, well-honed technical skills, and an ingrained passion for design, I am determined to forge solutions that are not only visually captivating but also user-centric and technically sound. I am propelled by an insatiable eagerness to keep growing and learning, confident in my ability to bring a distinct mix of skills to bear on any challenges that may be presented to me in the future.</p>

                    <h3>My experience</h3>
                    <p class="hidden-text">My professional path up to this point has been characterized by a diverse range of experiences, each contributing distinct facets to my skills repertoire and broadening my perspectives.

                        In the nascent stages of my career, I found myself venturing into the domain of customer service. It was in this field that I fine-tuned key competencies such as efficacious communication, problem-solving, and the demonstration of empathy. My daily interactions with customers presented various challenges, demanding an ability to adapt to diverse situations and exceed the expectations set before me. Such encounters facilitated my understanding of the importance of recognizing and addressing the needs of others. The competencies gained in this realm have remained pertinent in all my subsequent professional endeavours.
                        
                        During my academic journey at Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet), I was presented with the opportunity to assume the role of a student assistant. This position granted me the chance to deepen my grasp of computer engineering, while simultaneously allowing me to cultivate my leadership, mentoring, and pedagogical skills. I found myself tasked with the translation of intricate engineering concepts into comprehensible lessons for my peers. This exercise nurtured my capacity for lucid communication of technical information, a transferable skill that I am confident will prove invaluable in my current and future professional roles.
                        
                        In my current professional capacity, I serve as an interpreter, a role that harmonizes perfectly with my passion for languages. It provides a platform for leveraging my multilingual prowess to bridge communication gaps between diverse parties. Each day unfolds as a fresh opportunity for learning, as I perpetually seek to enhance my linguistic abilities and deepen my understanding of diverse cultures.
                        
                        As I peer into the future, I am enthusiastic about accruing even more enriching experiences that will continue to expand my horizons. I am convinced that the amalgamation of my technical, linguistic, and interpersonal skills will serve as a robust foundation, equipping me to tackle any challenges and seize any opportunities that lie in my path. I stand ready and invigorated for the journey that lies ahead, confident that the diversity of my experiences has primed me well for the inevitable uncertainties and novelties of the future.</p>
